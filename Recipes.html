<h1>Easy Chocolate Chip Cookies</h1>
<p>8 Tablespoons of unsalted butter, 1/3 cup plus 1 tablespoon of granulated sugar, 1/3 cups of light brown or dark brown sugar, packed, 1/2 teaspoon of table salt, 1 teaspoon of pure vanilla extract, 1/4 teaspoon of baking soda, 1/2 teaspoon of baking powder, 1 large egg, 1 1/2 cups of unbleached all-purpose flour. 2 tablespoons of milk, optional for cakier cookies. 2 cups (227g to 340g) of chips, nuts, and/or dried fruit, optional.</p>
<br>
<p>1. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit. Lightly grease two baking sheets, or line with parchment. 2. Beat together the butter, sugars, vanilla, salt, baking powder, and baking soda till well combined and lightened in color. 3. Add the egg, beating till smooth, scrape the sides of the bowl, and beat again till smooth. 4. Add the flour, mixing it in completely. 5. If you're making cookies using chips, nuts, etc., beat in the milk, then the add-ins. If you're making plain cookies, without the add-ins, omit the milk. 6. Drop the cookies by the generous tablespoon onto prepared baking sheets, spacing them about 2" apart. A tablespoon cookie scoop works well here. 7. Bake the cookies for 10 to 14 minutes (or up tp 16 minutes, ovens may vary). The cookies sould be a light golden brown, and a bit darker around the edges. For softer cookies, bake the shorter amount of time, for crunchier cookies, bake longer. 8. Remove the cookies from the oven, and cool right on the baking sheets. 9. Store these chocolate chip cookies airtight at room temperature for several days. Freeze for longer storage.</p>
